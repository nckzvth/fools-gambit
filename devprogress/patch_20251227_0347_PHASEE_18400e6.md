# patch_20251227_0347_PHASEE_18400e6

Phase:

- PHASEE (Web client MVP)

Scope summary (what changed):

- Rebuilt web prototype UI to be card-first (hover/click/drag/drop on cards; no side-panel action buttons required).
- Added dedicated carry slot + resolve lane + equipment slots as card frames, with token-to-card Fate actions and Fool (Leap) token.
- Switched to Tarot SVG art via a manifest and preloads all textures before enabling interactions (no mid-interaction asset loads).
- Kept save/resume + export/import action log (JSON) for reproducible runs.

Files changed:

- apps/web-client/src/index.html
- apps/web-client/src/main.ts
- apps/web-client/tsconfig.json
- apps/web-client/vite.config.ts
- packages/game-data/content/art/art.manifest.json
- devprogress/patch_20251227_0347_PHASEE_18400e6.md

Behavior changes (must map to spec sections):

- Web client remains rules-agnostic: gameplay decisions are executed only via `getLegalActions` + `applyAction` and engine events (spec §0.1, §2.1).
- Reorder prompts still require explicit confirm and log the chosen permutation via `REORDER_TOP3/REORDER_ROOM4` (spec §2.3).
- Random outcomes and key state transitions are surfaced via engine events in the optional log panel (spec §2.4).

New/updated tests:

- None (web client only)

Replays added/updated:

- None (web client only)

Content/schema changes:

- None

Migration notes:

- saveVersion bump? no
- migration implemented? no

Known issues / follow-ups:

- Action log export is schema-shaped but not yet validated against `packages/game-data/schemas/action_log.schema.json` in CI (planned Phase F).
- Rasterization pipeline (SVG → WebP/PNG) is not yet implemented; current prototype renders SVG-derived textures via Pixi and preloads upfront.

Next phase entry criteria checklist:

- [x] Pixi table, HUD, modals, log panel
- [x] UI driven by getLegalActions + applyAction events
- [x] save/resume
- [x] export/import action log
- [x] CI stays green (validate + typecheck + lint + test)
